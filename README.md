# LeadershipDevelopment
#### I was fortunate to be selected among 36 Young Educators from over 5000 applicants into the Indonesian Teaching Movement (GIM)
#### GIM is a movement—an effort to encourage everyone to participate in solving educational problems in Indonesia. Its vision is for all segments of  society  to  be  involved  in  the  effort  to  educate  the  nation  as  a  promise  of independence—a nation  filled  with  leaders  from  various  fields  with  global competencies and grassroots understanding.
